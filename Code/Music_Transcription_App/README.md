To set the environment before running the script (in windows power shell) run:
$env:NODE_ENV="production" (or "development")
node try.js

To check what's the value of NODE_ENV run:
echo $env:NODE_ENV

Note: The environment variable NODE_ENV will be set only for the duration of the
session. If you open a new PowerShell window or tab, you’ll need to set it again.
