            Stellar Intelligence is a company that uses and develops new AI technologies, 
            in order to make its enormous power accessible to everyone, and by that 
            advance the human civilization as a whole.

            Beethoven is a service developed By Stellar Intelligence for this exact 
            purpose - to give everyone the ability to take any music source and generate 
            note-sheets playable by musical instruments.
      
            Here in Stellar Intelligence we beleive that AI techniologies and its products 
            should help mankind, and not threaten them. As such, we follow a moral compass 
            and always ask ourselves: "Is this going to create more good or more evil?"
