            Stellar Intelligence is a general purpose research company that focuses on many 
            fields, such as economy and technology. 
            We use and develop new AI technologies, in order to perform and pulish tools 
            and discoveries in all sorts of fields, and to make the enormous power of AI 
            accessible for everyone, and by that advance the human civilization as a whole.

            Beethoven is a service developed By Stellar Intelligence for this exact 
            purpose - to give everyone the ability to take any music source and generate 
            note-sheets playable by common musical instruments.
      
            Here in Stellar Intelligence we beleive that AI techniologies and its products 
            should help mankind, and not threaten them. As such, we follow a moral compass 
            and always ask ourselves: "Is this going to make the world a better place or not?"
